Description: Which frameworks, if any, would you like to start on boot?
 Which of these frameworks would you like to start on boot? The boot script will be used with SystemD, so if you are running Devuan or another SystemD-less distro, please don't choose any. MRL will launch /etc/asimov-robotics/mrl/init.py while ROS will launch /etc/asimov-robotics/ros/init.launch
